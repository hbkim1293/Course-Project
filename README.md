## Shiny application and Reproducible Pitch
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, I created a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I used Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

### Shiny application
I created a shiny application which show you a tree plot of Iris data, and tell you the Iris species depending on the value that you entered in the application.
